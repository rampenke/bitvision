## Quickstarter

This template contains all the required installation instructions, scripts, and files and functions for:
- Installing Miner and Validator for BitVision subnet.
- Explains incentive mechanisms on the subnet.

## Introduction

The BitVision subnet hosts AI models for improving Video Transcoding:

Subnet consists of:
- Subnet miners and subnet validators.
- A protocol using which the subnet miners and subnet validators interact with one another. This protocol is part of the incentive mechanism.
- The Bittensor API using which the subnet miners and subnet validators interact with Bittensor's onchain consensus engine [Yuma Consensus](https://bittensor.com/documentation/validating/yuma-consensus). The Yuma Consensus is designed to drive these actors: subnet validators and subnet miners, into agreement on who is creating value and what that value is worth. 

This repo is split into three primary files. These files are:
1. `bittensor/protocol.py`: Contains the definition of the protocol used by subnet miners and subnet validators.
2. `neurons/miner.py`: Script that defines the subnet miner's behavior, i.e., how the subnet miner responds to requests from subnet validators.
3. `neurons/validator.py`: This script defines the subnet validator's behavior, i.e., how the subnet validator requests information from the subnet miners and determines the scores.

## Installation

### Before you proceed
Before you proceed with the installation of the subnet, note the following: 

- Use these instructions to run your subnet locally for your development and testing, or on Bittensor testnet or on Bittensor mainnet. 
- **IMPORTANT**: We **strongly recommend** that you first run your subnet locally and complete your development and testing before running the subnet on Bittensor testnet. Furthermore, make sure that you next run your subnet on Bittensor testnet before running it on the Bittensor mainnet.
- You can run your subnet either as a subnet owner, or as a subnet validator or as a subnet miner. 
- **IMPORTANT:** Make sure you are aware of the minimum compute requirements for your subnet. See the [Minimum compute YAML configuration](./min_compute.yml).
- Note that installation instructions differ based on your situation: For example, installing for local development and testing will require a few additional steps compared to installing for testnet. Similarly, installation instructions differ for a subnet owner vs a validator or a miner. 

### Install

- **Running locally**: Follow the step-by-step instructions described in this section: [Running Subnet Locally](./docs/running_on_staging.md).
- **Running on Bittensor testnet**: Follow the step-by-step instructions described in this section: [Running on the Test Network](./docs/running_on_testnet.md).
- **Running on Bittensor mainnet**: Follow the step-by-step instructions described in this section: [Running on the Main Network](./docs/running_on_mainnet.md).
